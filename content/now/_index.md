## Living
I recently moved to Utrecht.
I am still settling down, and exploring the city and surroundings.

## Working
I work as a PhD candidate at Utrecht University on the [QuAnGIS project](https://www.questionbasedanalysis.com/).

The goal of my project is to be able to describe the usability of geo-data sources for answering questions in human geography.

## Reading
* I'm reading *A Brief History of Time* by Stephen Hawking.

## Side projects
* I'm updating my website, and will probably tweak a lot of stuff over the next several months.
