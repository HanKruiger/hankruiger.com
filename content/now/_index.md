This is my now page.
Here, you can read about what I'm focusing on at this point in my life.

## Living
I recently moved to Utrecht.
I am still settling down, and exploring the city and surroundings.

## Working
I work as a PhD candidate at Utrecht University on the [QuAnGIS project](https://www.questionbasedanalysis.com/).
Some of my current activities:
* Learning about [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/about) and the many ways of accessing and using that data.
* Learning [QGIS](https://qgis.org/).
* Preparing a short presentation for the [COSIT conference](https://cosit2019.ur.de/).

The goal of my project is to be able to describe the usability of geo-data sources for answering questions in human geography.

## Reading
* I'm reading *The Return of the King*, the third volume of the *Lord of the Rings* trilogy by J. R. R. Tolkien.

## Side projects
* I'm updating my website, and will probably tweak a lot of stuff over the next several months.
