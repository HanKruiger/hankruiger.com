Start the demo:

::start-demo-button
::

Spawn an agent:

::u-button{id="spawn-agent" label="Spawn agent" icon="lucide:user-plus"}
::

Give them some behaviour:

::u-button{id="walk-lr-naive" label="Walk left-right (naive)"}
::

Add the same behaviour, but with Bevy Behave:

::u-button{id="walk-lr" label="Walk left-right (behave)"}
::

- The nice thing is that the logic in the system only has to care about its own task, and can just give control back to the behaviour tree when its task is done.

Enable hunger & eating:

::u-button{id="enable-hunger" label="Enable hunger & eating"}
::

Make some fruit appear:

::u-button{id="spawn-fruit-spawner" label="Make fruit appear"}
::

Enable move to fruit behaviour:

::u-button{id="move-to-fruit" label="Move to fruit"}
::
