Conway Checkers (or: [Conway's Soldiers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Soldiers)) is a single player game on a checkerboard with an interesting twist: the board is infinite.

Infinite objects aren't really compatible with physical space, so I made [a thing where you can play it](https://demos.hankruiger.com/conway-checkers/).

The rules are simple:
1. You set up the game by placing your pieces below a horizontal line. You can use any number of pieces you like.
2. The goal is to move any of your pieces *above* the line as far as possible.
3. The only legal move is to—vertically or horizontally—jump over an adjacent piece to an empty spot. The adjacent piece dies during this process.

I challenge you to beat my highscore: 4.
