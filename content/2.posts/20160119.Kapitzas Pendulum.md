When you hold a pendulum upright—with its mass above the pivot point—it will tumble down, right?

Well, if you vertically shake it at [just the right frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kapitza%27s_pendulum#Equilibrium_positions) it won't, and [this simulation](https://demos.hankruiger.com/inverted-pendulum) demonstrates that!
