## Work experience

### (2020 - present) Scientist Innovator at [TNO](https://www.tno.nl/)
I work in projects with applications in several industries involving data sharing and interoperability.

Tech:
- Java
- Python
- JavaScript
- [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com)
- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) + [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) = [wasm-bindgen](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen)
- [Apache Jena](https://jena.apache.org)
- [Semantic Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web)
- [GitLab CI/CD](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/)

### (2019 - 2020) PhD student at Utrecht University
I worked in the [QuAnGIS project](https://www.questionbasedanalysis.com/).

The focus of my work was to be able to describe the usability of geo-data sources for answering questions in human geography.
These descriptions should be processable by a machine, so that question answering can be automated.

Tech:
- Python
- [Semantic Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web)
- [MarkLogic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MarkLogic_Server)

### (2018 - 2019) Data scientist / Developer at Belsimpel
At [Belsimpel](https://www.belsimpel.nl/), I contributed to multiple things in a really nice team.
I started working on the in-house [A/B testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing) system that I helped turn into a mature system.
I also worked on visual analytics and predictive analysis for the back office portal.

Before starting at Belsimpel, I had no experience with PHP (the language used there) at all, but the working environment allowed me to quickly learn and grow into a position where I was responsible for important technical parts of the company.

I enjoyed utilizing software engineering practices like code reviews, issue trackers, scheduling releases, and testing.

Tech:
- PHP
- SQL
- JavaScript
- [Laravel](https://laravel.com/)
- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)
- [D3.js](https://d3js.org/)
- [GitLab CI/CD](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/)

### (2017) Research internship at VMware
I spent the Summer of 2017 at [VMware Research](https://research.vmware.com/) in Palo Alto, California.
Apart from excellent sightseeing and many road trips, I spent time working on [Hillview](https://research.vmware.com/projects/hillview), a big data spreadsheet.
My focus was on visualisation, and the aim was to [integrate dimensionality reduction methods](https://github.com/vmware/hillview/pull/154) into Hillview.

Tech:
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [D3.js](https://d3js.org/)
- Java
- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)

### (2016 - 2017) PhD student at University of Groningen
I did research on data visualisation.
Specifically, I focused on using dimensionality reduction to visualise datasets.

One of the projects I worked on was to apply dimensionality reduction techniques to the problem of graph layouts.
This resulted in [tsNET](https://doi.org/10.1111/cgf.13187).

[Another project](http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~telea001/InfoVis/PNIELD) involved navigating through large high-dimensional datasets.

I made [my first contribution to established open-source software](https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/merge_requests/1171) during this time.

Tech:
- Python
- C

## Education

### (2014 - 2016) Computing Science MSc at University of Groningen
During my master's, I was very interested in modelling, simulation, and visualisation.

I made a (retrospectively not very pretty) [visualisation of a model of Kapitza's pendulum](https://demos.hankruiger.com/inverted-pendulum/).

I also made a [demonstration of a force-directed graph drawing method](https://demos.hankruiger.com/graph-editor/), because I was intrigued by this.

In 2016, I graduated with honours!

Tech:
- MATLAB / GNU Octave
- C/C++
- Python
- JavaScript
- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)

### (2013 - 2014) Computing Science pre-MSc at University of Groningen
Because I switched to Computing Science, I had to catch up by following a few courses.

### (2010 - 2013) Physics BSc at University of Groningen
My favourite courses were *Mechanics and Relativity*, and *Introduction to Programming and Numerical Methods*.

I did a minor in Computing Science, which drove me to persue a master's degree in Computing Science afterwards.

Tech:
- MATLAB / GNU Octave
- C
