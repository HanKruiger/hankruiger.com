# Who is this guy?
This guy is Han.
Han was born in Groningen in 1992, and he will stop writing in third person now.

At some point, I moved to Friesland, where I finished my primary and secondary education.
During this time I picked up playing the **guitar**, and appreciating **music** in general.
As many teenagers do, I liked video games, and spent many hours playing games like *Rollercoaster Tycoon*, *RuneScape*, *A2 Racer*, *Tony Hawk's Pro Skater*, and others.

After finishing secondary school in Leeuwarden, I moved to Groningen to study **Physics**.
Physics is cool, because it aims to *understand everything that exists in the universe*.

So, naturally, I embarked expecting to solve the ultimate mysteries of life, the universe, and everything.
(Not really, but I was hopeful and inspired. Today I am also realistic.)
Unfortunately, I didn't develop a theory of everything (yet!).
But I did develop skills in analytic problem solving, learned a lot of interesting stuff, and even [got published in an academic journal](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4907277) as a result of my bachelor thesis on spectroscopy simulations!

Computer simulations intrigue me, and that pushed me to follow a master programme in **Computing Science**[^1].
I really enjoyed this, as software allows me to easily build things that are interesting and useful (but mostly interesting).
In the later stages of the programme I focused on data visualisation.
My master thesis on graph drawing also led to [a publication](https://doi.org/10.1111/cgf.13187).

I spent more time doing research on data visualisation in Groningen, and did a 3-month internship at VMware in Palo Alto, California, working on [Hillview](https://github.com/vmware/hillview).

At some point, I shifted gears to do work in industry.
For about a year I worked as a Data Scientist / Developer at [Belsimpel](https://www.belsimpel.nl), in their office that is beautifully located in the heart of Groningen.
There, I worked on the in-house A/B testing system, visual business analytics, and other things.

After doing work in industry for a year, I decided it was time to go back to research and I applied for a PhD position at Utrecht University to work on automated question-answering in geographical information systems.
Fortunately, I was hired, and this is what I do now.

[^1]: Note that the programme in Groningen is called Comput*ing* Science, as opposed to the [more prevalent](https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=computer+science%2Ccomputing+science) Comput*er* Science.
Comput*ing* Science implies that it focuses on how things can be computed, whereas Comput*er* Science implies that the goal is to study computers.
