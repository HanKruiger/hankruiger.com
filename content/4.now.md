This is my [now page](https://nownownow.com/about){:target="_blank"}.
Here, you can read about what I'm doing at this point in my life.

## General

- I live in Groningen with my girlfriend and our cat.

## Work

- I work as a *full stack developer* & *team lead* at [New Nexus](https://newnexus.nl/){:target="_blank"}.

## Hobbies

- I am currently getting more into running.

## Books

I recently read:

- *In Onze Tijd: Leven in het Calamiteitperk* by *Tim Fransen*. This book explains the geopolitical shifts that happened in the last few decades, puts it in a historic and philosophical context, enumerates the calamities that we're currently facing, and tries to give some hopeful perspectives. Sounds grim, but the comedic sprinkles make it very enjoyable and more light-hearted than you'd expect!
