This is my [now page](https://nownownow.com/about).
Here, you can read about what I'm focusing on at this point in my life.

## General
I recently moved (back) to Groningen.

## Working
I work as a *Scientist Innovator* at the [Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research (TNO)](https://www.tno.nl/en/).
Most of my activities are related to data interoperability, front- and backend development, and ontology engineering.

Currently, I'm doing a lot with [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com) and [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/).

## Reading
I'm reading:

- *The History of Bees* by Maja Lunde
- *Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban* by J.K. Rowling

## Watching
I recently watched and enjoyed:

- *Brooklyn Nine-Nine*
- *Severance*
- *Ted Lasso*
- *The Witcher*
