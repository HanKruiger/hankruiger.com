This is my [now page](https://nownownow.com/about).
Here, you can read about what I'm doing at this point in my life.

## General
I live in Groningen with my girlfriend and our cat.

## Work
I work as a *Scientist Innovator* at the [Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research (TNO)](https://www.tno.nl/en/).
Most of my activities are related to data interoperability, front- and backend development, and ontology engineering.

Currently, I'm doing a lot with [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com), [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and the [Knowledge Engine](https://github.com/tno/knowledge-engine).

# Personal tech stuff

- I am yet again prototyping a 2D multiplayer RPG game, this time using [Godot 4](https://godotengine.org) & Python.
- I joined the Mastodon hype train and can be found at [mastodon.nl/@hankruiger](https://mastodon.nl/@hankruiger). You can be my first follower!
- Playing around with (and being amazed by) Stable Diffusion using [this Mac app](https://diffusionbee.com).
