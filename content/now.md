This is my [now page](https://nownownow.com/about).
Here, you can read about what I'm doing at this point in my life.

## General
I live in Groningen with my girlfriend and our cat.

After reading Tiago Forte's *Building a Second Brain* I try to get into the habit of note-taking.

## Work
I work as a *Scientist Innovator* at the [Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research (TNO)](https://www.tno.nl/en/).
Most of my activities are related to data interoperability, front- and backend (web) development, and ontology engineering.

Currently, I'm doing a lot with [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com), [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and the [Knowledge Engine](https://github.com/tno/knowledge-engine).

## Social web stuff

I am on Mastodon and can be found at [mastodon.nl/@hankruiger](https://mastodon.nl/@hankruiger). Using the excellent [Ivory](https://tapbots.com/ivory/) client.

## Reading
I'm reading:

- *The Name of the Wind* by Patrick Rothfuss
- *Chaos Monkeys* by Antonio García Martínez
