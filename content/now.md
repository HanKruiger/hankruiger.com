This is my [now page](https://nownownow.com/about).
Here, you can read about what I'm focusing on at this point in my life.

## Working
I work as a *Junior Scientist Innovator* at the [Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research (TNO)](https://www.tno.nl/en/).
Most of my activities are related to data interoperability, front- and backend development, and ontology engineering.

## Reading
I'm reading *The Order of Time* by Carlo Rovelli.

## Watching
I recently watched and enjoyed:

- *The Queen's Gambit*
- *The Restaurant* (*Vår tid är nu*)

## Building
I'm building a [library for geometric operations in hexagonal grids](https://gitlab.com/hankruiger/bestagon) in Rust. 
My plan is to use it in a video game at some point.
