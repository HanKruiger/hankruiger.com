This is my [now page](https://nownownow.com/about).
Here, you can read about what I'm doing at this point in my life.

## General
I live in Groningen with my girlfriend and our cat.

## Work
In September, I will start as a *full-stack developer* at [New Nexus](https://newnexus.nl/).

Until then, I work as a *Scientist Innovator* at the [Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research (TNO)](https://www.tno.nl/en/).
Most of my activities are related to data interoperability, front- and backend (web) development, and ontology engineering.

## Social web stuff

I am on Mastodon and can be found at [mastodon.nl/@hankruiger](https://mastodon.nl/@hankruiger). Using the excellent [Ivory](https://tapbots.com/ivory/) client.
