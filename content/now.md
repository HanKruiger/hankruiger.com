## Working
*I am looking for new job opportunities because I will drop out of this position in February. I hope to find a developer / data analysis position at an organisation that is relevant for society.*

I work as a PhD candidate at Utrecht University on the [QuAnGIS project](https://www.questionbasedanalysis.com/).

The goal of my project is to be able to describe the usability of geo-data sources for answering questions in human geography.

## Reading
* I'm reading *The Count of Monte Cristo* by Alexandre Dumas.

## Side projects
* I'm learning Danish on Duolingo.
* I'm de-Googling my digital life.
