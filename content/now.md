This is my [now page](https://nownownow.com/about).
Here, you can read about what I'm focusing on at this point in my life.

## Working
I work as a *Junior Scientist Innovator* at the [Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research (TNO)](https://www.tno.nl/en/).
Most of my activities are related to data interoperability, front- and backend development, and ontology engineering.

## Reading
I'm reading *The Secret Commonwealth* by Philip Pullman.

## Watching
I recently watched and enjoyed:

- *The Queen's Gambit*
- *The Restaurant* (*Vår tid är nu*)
- *The Crown*

## Building
I'm experimenting with [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) to see if it's a good fit for a video game idea.
